## Development Planes
- The site was designed by the developer and was inspired by developers experience and interaction with friends in finding it difficult to pick a movie that is worth watching on Movie Apps because there are hundreds of movies to pick from and cannot know which one to pick.

- The website needs **users** to be able to:
    * See recommended movies grouped in a selected class
    * Recommend movies to others
    * Watch movie trailers
    * See entertainment news

- The website needs the **developer** to be able to:
    * Upload movie trailers weekly
    * Collect recommended movies by users
    * Filter the recommendation page regularly using users recommendations

               - To watch recommended movies

- One of the **navigation links** has a dropdown that only appears when clicked and each leads to another page.
- On the recommendation page which is a long page, sets of links to other sections of the same page was provided to allow users navigate through different sections of the page with ease.
- There is a **Footer** that contains the appropriate **social media icons** linking users to the social media that each represents but not anyone's media page. It also contains a link to entertainment news page.

          </li>
          <li><strong>Recommend Container</strong> - Nicely placed below the description text on the Home page with a transparent box over the background image. This was designed to increase and encourage users to recommend movies since it is the first page to be seen upon opening site. In this, there is a <strong>call to action</strong> button linking the <strong>suggest a movie page</strong> where users can fill out the form to recommend movies.
          </li>
     </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="movie-app.html" target="_blank" alt="Movie App Page">Movie App Page</a></dt>
  <dd>The movie app page is one of the three sub pages of recommendation page, the other two which are <strong>Genres and Production year</strong>have similar set-up and design. It is designed recommending movies to users based on the App where it can be watched.  
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Images</strong> - On a small screen the images(Movie Posters) are set to be stacked above the text. On a larger screen however, they appear taking 1/3rd of the page nicely placed on the left side of the screen
          </li>
          <li><strong>Card text</strong> - Card texts is the section that contains description of the images and a small link. On small screens, the texts appear below the images they are describing. On larger screens, they occupy the remaining 2/3rd of the page appearing on the right side of the images. 
          </li>
          <li><strong>Navigation links</strong> - On movie app page is a set of links that is set to appear at the middle of the page, it contains links that leads to other sections of the same page since it's a long page. The links have a border color similar to the Headings of the sections to maintain the continuity on the page. The links are stacked on each other at the center of the page on a small screen and spreads out as the screen widens.
          </li>

## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
### First time visitor goals
1. As a first time user, I want to be able to understand the purpose of the website at a glance.
    * Upon opening the site, the user is welcomed by a captivating background image which is an outdoor cinema with  heading plain on the image telling first time users what we do.
    * On the Navigation bar are lists of instructions telling the user what each pages will do once clicked.
    * Also on the background that user will see first is a box telling users to make recommendations with a call to action button
    * At the foot of the page are social media links with icons ease in once hover over to captivate users.

2. As a first time user, I want to be able to navigate through the site with ease.
    * On the top of the page upon entry are links that directly inform users what each pages do and contents that might be found in them.
    * The Navigation bar is fixed thereby making it easier for users to see the links at all times and not feel trapped and the need to scroll all through to the top before they can leave current page.
    * On the recommendation page which is a long page, smaller links is made available at start of each section just making users a click away from other sections. 
    * The foot of the page has links that takes the user outside the tab they are working and this is made so users can return to the site without having to search again.

3. As a first time user, I want to be able to make recommendations easily without typing too much.
    * Upon entry, there is a call to action button visibly placed on the background image asking users to make recommendations. This button leads to a page where there is a form to be filled.
    * The form is designed to make it easier for users to recommend easily by just typing in one field and clicking to fill others.
    * After filling the required field in the form and the submit button is clicked, the page is refreshed and the user can use the navigation links to go to any other desired page.

4. I want to be able to contact or follow the site owner on social media for any questions or update.
    * At the foot of all pages is a list of social media icons that lead the user to the social media page of the site. However because the site is not real, the links do not lead to the site's social media pages as at this time.

### Returning Visitor Goals
1. As a returning user, I want to be able to see new movie suggestions weekly on site.
    * On returning to the page, the user can go to the movies of the week page by clicking on the navigation link and it will take the user to the weekly edited page of the website.

2. I want to be able to recommend movies and be able to ask how my recommendations are used.
    * The home page has a little captivating box which asks users if they would love to recommend a movie. This is visibly and neatly placed on the home page and the same button when clicked leads to a form for recommendation.
    * On every page is a link that users can click to display a recommendation form to suggest movies for others. The form is made simply, easy and quick to fill.

3. As a returning user, I want to be able to watch suggested movies of the week trailers.
    * On all pages is a link that leads users to the page where suggested movies for that week are.
    * Each movie trailers have controls that enables users to play and pause the movie trailers. 

## Further Testing

 * The website was tested on all browsers using different devices; Laptop, Tablets, Androids(Samsung S10+, Samsung S20), iphone7 and iPhoneX.
 * Friends and families were asked to check the website on various devices with different browsers to ensure all links are functioning well.

## Issues and Bugs

**Background-image bug** - While testing the site with different browsers, Internet Explorer couldn't load all background images. In researching the cause online and using the Dev tools, the developer discovered that setting the backgroundd image this way{html:background-image} was making images to not respond and same was changed.

**Footer bug** - The footer whenever the orientation of the device is changed was overlapping the contents in section. A mini project done in Bootstrap in Code Institute course(Rosie-s-resume) was revised and steps followed to solve the bug

**Suggest a movie form** - Select option(Second field on the form)could not be made a required field. In researching, a Bootstrap components was found and used to resolve the issue.

**Recommendation page bug** - The recommendation page was made to have dropdown using Bootstrap component. When clicked it displays the dropdown and the recommendation link itself does not lead to the linked page. After researching, the developer could write a code to overrule Bootstraps.
